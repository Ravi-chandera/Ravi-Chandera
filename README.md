# Hello, I am Ravi Chandera
I am working in AI at convegenius ai. I am part of product that generates insights from databases. On system level, It is Natural Language(NL) to SQL problem. I have made product complex so users can get insights with simple english text. Used agents, parallel processing, cost savings, fine tuning of embedding models, prompting and caching to solve complex user questions. Automated entire pipeline so addition of new datasets became one click process. 
# Skills 
1. Python
2. Pytorch/ Tensorflow
3. API - Flask
4. Databases - PostgreSQL
5. MLOps - Hydra, Git actions, CI & CD, weights & biases, AWS Lambda, Docker

# Education
I have master's in **Artificial Intelligence from IIT Patna**. There I did one year of research project with TCS. It was about Insights generations from multimodal disaster data. Aprt from that, coursework taught me machine learning, NLP and computer vision. Assigments taught me about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction techniques to extract meaningful insights and improve model performance.

I did bachelor's in **Mechanical Engineering**. There I did learn about robotics, industry 4.0 and optimization. Also gained strong hold on probability and statistics. And learned about cars, hell yehh.

# Why should you hire me?
If you want to get positive business impact with your data, I am the right guy for you. Even if you just have idea in mind and no data, I can help you convert that idea to impact. I can help you for data collection, model building, model deployment, and many more things... Really, what else do you need?
