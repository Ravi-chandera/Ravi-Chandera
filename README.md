# Hello there, I am Ravi Chandera
Hi there! 
I am pursuing a master's in **Artificial Intelligence at IIT Patna**. I have a strong foundation in advanced **statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning techniques**, enabling me to develop accurate and robust predictive models.

My work includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction techniques to extract meaningful insights and improve model performance.

My programming background in Python helps to utilise libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and sci-kit-learn to implement data science algorithms and perform data manipulation and visualisation.

Specialisation in **natural language processing (NLP)** helps me to understand both traditional and state-of-the-art NLP techniques, allowing me to design and develop innovative solutions for language-related challenges.

I know the design and implementation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and advanced architectures such as ResNet, VGG, and Inception. This allows me to achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks.
