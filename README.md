5. MLOps - Hydra, Git actions, CI & CD, weights & biases, AWS Lambda, Docker

# Education
I have master's in **Artificial Intelligence from IIT Patna**. There I did one year of research project with TCS. It was about Insights generations from multimodal disaster data. Aprt from that, coursework taught me machine learning, NLP and computer vision. Assigments taught me about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and dimensionality reduction techniques to extract meaningful insights and improve model performance.
